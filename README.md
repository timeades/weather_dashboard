# Weather Dashboard

This application is a weather dashboard that allows users to input their location and the current weather conditions along with the condition for the next 5 days is returned.

It utalises a couple of APIs from https://openweathermap.org/ to retrieve the information which is dynamically loaded to the html, In this exercise I have used JQuery & Bootstrap.
